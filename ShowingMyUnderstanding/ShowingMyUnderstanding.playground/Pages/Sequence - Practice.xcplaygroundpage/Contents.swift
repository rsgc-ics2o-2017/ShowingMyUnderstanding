 # Sequence - Practice
 
 When does sequence matter?

 Here is an example of an image that is created and depends on statements being run in a certain order:

 ![overlapping_shapes](overlapping_shapes.png "Overlapping Shapes Logo")

 In this shape, there are lines and circles used.

 [Color](http://russellgordon.ca/rsgc/2016-17/ics2o/HSB_Colour_Model_-_Summary_-_Swift_3.pdf) and alpha (transparency) matter.

 Try reproducing this image for practice.
